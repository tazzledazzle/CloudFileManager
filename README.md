## 3. User Stories and Use Cases

### 3.1 Core Use Cases

1. **Intelligent File Storage**
    * "As a user, I want to upload files and have them automatically analyzed and organized so I can find them later without manual tagging."
    * "As a user, I want the system to understand what my documents contain so I can search by content rather than just filenames."
2. **Advanced Search**
    * "As a researcher, I want to search through my PDFs based on their content so I can quickly find relevant papers."
    * "As a business owner, I want to search for all files containing specific terms or concepts across various file formats."
3. **Security and Compliance**
    * "As a user, I want my files to be automatically scanned for viruses so I can be confident my data is secure."
    * "As a compliance officer, I want to ensure no sensitive information is stored in an insecure manner."
4. **Analysis and Insights**
    * "As a team leader, I want to understand what types of documents my team works with most frequently."
    * "As a content creator, I want to analyze the themes and subjects appearing across my work."

### 3.2 Detailed User Scenarios

**Scenario 1: The Legal Professional&#x20;**&#x52;achel is a lawyer who manages hundreds of case documents. She uploads all her files to the Cloud File Manager. When she needs to find precedents for a new case, she simply searches for relevant legal concepts. The system returns documents where these concepts appear, even if the exact terms weren't in the filenames or manually tagged.

**Scenario 2: The Research Team&#x20;**&#x41; research team uploads their collection of papers and data. The system automatically extracts information about methodologies, findings, and subject matter. Team members can quickly find all papers using a particular research method or discussing specific phenomena, even across different authors and file formats.

**Scenario 3: The Small Business&#x20;**&#x41; marketing agency uploads client materials and campaign assets. The system automatically categorizes them by client, campaign type, and content. When a team member needs to find "all video advertisements for the healthcare sector," the search works even if the files weren't manually organized that way.
