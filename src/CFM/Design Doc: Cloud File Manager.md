# Cloud File Manager with Metadata Analysis: Design Document
## **1. Introduction**
### **1.1 Purpose and Overview**
This document outlines the design for a comprehensive cloud file manager system that analyzes uploaded files and provides metadata insights. The system leverages AWS services while carefully staying within free tier limits, making it cost-effective while maintaining robust functionality.

The Cloud File Manager will provide users with the ability to upload, store, search, and analyze files through a web interface. Beyond basic storage capabilities, the system will extract valuable metadata from files, perform security scanning, and employ machine learning to classify and extract insights from documents.
### **1.2 Design Goals**
 * Create a serverless architecture leveraging AWS free tier services
 * Implement robust security measures including virus scanning and content validation
 * Provide automated metadata extraction and analysis capabilities
 * Develop machine learning models for document classification and insights
 * Design a responsive and intuitive web interface
 * Ensure cost optimization while maintaining scalability
## **2. System Architecture**
### **2.1 High-Level Architecture**
The system follows a serverless architecture pattern with four primary layers:
**1. Storage Layer**: Manages file storage and metadata persistence using S3 and DynamoDB
**2. Compute Layer**: Handles file processing, analysis, and API functionality through Lambda functions
**3. Security Layer**: Provides comprehensive protection through validation, scanning, and access controls
**4. Analytics Layer**: Extracts insights from files using AWS services and custom ML models

### **2.2 Component Interaction**
The system works through the following core flows:
1. Users upload files through the web interface directly to S3 via presigned URLs
2. Upload triggers metadata extraction Lambda functions
3. Files undergo validation and virus scanning
4. Metadata is stored in DynamoDB and made searchable
5. ML pipeline processes files for classification and insight extraction
6. Web interface provides search, visualization, and management capabilities
